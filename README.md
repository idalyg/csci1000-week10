# GitHub Group Project Overview

## Overview: Understanding GitHub and Collaborative Skills
This GitHub Group Project introduces first-semester computer science students to the basics of version control and collaborative coding using GitHub, a vital tool in the professional programming world. Through this project, students will learn to manage repositories, work in teams, and develop skills that are critical for success in future projects at the University of Colorado Boulder.

## Learning Objectives
- **Develop technical proficiency in GitHub**: Configure GitHub profiles, set up repositories, and perform essential tasks such as commits, pull requests, and conflict resolution.
- **Enhance teamwork and collaboration**: Collaborate in a group setting using GitHub, communicate effectively, and share responsibilities in real-time.
- **Understand version control principles**: Learn key version control concepts such as cloning repositories, committing changes, resolving conflicts, and managing workflows.
- **Reflect on group dynamics and contributions**: Engage in peer reviews, reflect on team and individual performance, offer constructive feedback, and identify areas for improvement.
